Queries

Scenario get data between two date time datetime(2019-09-09 06:00:00) And datetime(2019-09-10 06:30:00) And which has type as Error and RoleInstanceName should contains container inside it like free search and Message should start with JWT Token expired.



//KQL Format
let startDate=datetime(2019-09-09 06:00:00);
let endDate=datetime(2019-09-10 06:30:00);
SmartLog
| where TimeStamp between (startDate .. endDate) and RoleInstanceName contains "container"
| where Type =="ERROR"
|where Message startswith "JWT token expired"
| order by TimeStamp desc
| take  10
 
 
//SQL Format
Select top 10 * FROM SmartLog
where TimeStamp between cast( '2019-09-09 06:00:00' as DateTime) And cast( '2019-09-10 06:30:00' as DateTime) and RoleInstanceName like '%container%'
And Type='ERROR'
And Message like 'JWT token expired%'
order by TimeStamp desc


Now in above scenario we want to add one more filter on json column i.e. Properties which contains MachineName,userName,identity we can do it with following KQL query.

As of now SQL syntax does not support json Parse inside Kusto.explorer

KQL Syntax
let startDate=datetime(2019-09-09 06:00:00);
let endDate=datetime(2019-09-10 06:30:00);
SmartLog
| where TimeStamp between (startDate .. endDate) and RoleInstanceName contains "container"
| where Type =="ERROR"
| where Message startswith "JWT token expired"
| extend Props=parse_json(Properties)
| extend HostName=Props.["log4net:HostName"]
| where HostName == "b114e01a4dce"
| order by TimeStamp desc
| project Properties,LoggerName,Type,Message,TimeStamp

Get data for particular Smart Transaction Id for specific date period.

queries
//Get logs for particular transaction id in between two dates
//KQL Query
let startDate=datetime(2019-09-01);
let endDate=datetime(2019-09-10);
SmartLog
| where TimeStamp between (startDate .. endDate)
| where SMARTTransactionId contains 'SmartTransactionID'
| order by TimeStamp desc
| take 10
 
//SQL Query
Select top 10 * FROM SmartLog where TimeStamp between cast( '20190901' as Date) And cast( '20190910' as Date)  AND SMARTTransactionId = 'SmartTransactionID' order by TimeStamp


Get records for particular buyer partner Code for Specific date period.

// Get records for particular buyer partner Code for Specific date period.
//KQL Query
let startDate=datetime(2019-08-01);
let endDate=datetime(2019-09-11);
SmartLog
| where  BuyerPartnerCode ==1
| order by TimeStamp desc
 
//SQL Query
Select * FROM SmartLog where TimeStamp between cast( '20190801' as Date) And cast( '20190909' as Date)  AND BuyerPartnerCode =1 order by TimeStamp desc

Searching in All Columns with free text seach

// For particular date period we want to search in all columns for specify string like portal



let startDate=datetime(2019-09-09 06:00:00);
let endDate=datetime(2019-09-10 06:30:00);
SmartLog
| where TimeStamp between (startDate .. endDate) and RoleInstanceName contains "container"
| search 'portal'
| take 10


#	Tip	Prefer	Over	
1	Prefer to use a single searchoperator over several consecutive search operators	search "billg" and ("steveb" or "satyan")	search "billg" | search "steveb" or "satyan"	
2	Prefer to filter inside the searchoperator	search "billg" and "steveb"	search * | where * has "billg" and * has "steveb"
